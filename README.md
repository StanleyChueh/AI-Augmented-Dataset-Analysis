# AI-Augmented-Dataset-Analysis
I am conducting a comparative analysis of machine learning model performance using datasets composed of AI-generated and real images, focusing on key metrics like True Positives, False Positives, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

## Introduction
A dataset: Total of 100 images, and all were taken by camera(size=>320x240)

=> [Real_100.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16643139/Real_100.zip)

B dataser: Total of 100 images, and 20 were taken by camera, rest of them were generated by Dreambooth(LoRA)

=> [AI_80_Real_20.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16643138/AI_80_Real_20.zip)

C dataset: Total of 20 images, and all were taken by camera
## Procedure


## Experiment Result
### A dataset(100 Real) & B dataset(20 real, 80 AI) comparison
#### F1 score
 ![output (4)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/429cf156-0d32-40fa-b863-465d3115a921)

#### True Positive
![output](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a06f6cd-b1a1-4be9-937c-8c774673314b)

#### False Positive
![output (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03826c5c-0c08-4f46-b9db-e93e8d2c0091)

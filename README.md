# AI-Augmented-Dataset-Analysis
I am conducting a comparative analysis of machine learning model(Yolov5) performance using datasets composed of AI-generated and real images, focusing on key metrics like True Positives, False Positives, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

## Introduction
A dataset: Total of 100 images, and all were taken by camera

B dataser: Total of 100 images, and 20 were taken by camera, rest of them were generated by Dreambooth(LoRA)

## Procedure

## Experiment Result
### A dataset(100 Real) & B dataset(20 real, 80 AI) comparison
Class name:

0: Sedan or SUV

1: Truck, Bus

2: Biker

3: Cyclist

4: Pedestrian
#### Predictable Result

A dataset(100 of real images)
